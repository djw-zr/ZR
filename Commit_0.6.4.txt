Commit 0.6.4
============

    ZR was initially developed using the Australian Zig-zag route and the
    standard MSTS routes.  Tests with other routes showed a number of bugs,
    some of which being due to errors in the route files which OpenRails
    sidesteps.  This commit includes a number of bug fixes of both kinds.
    
    OpenAL, which as used for sound, usually the limits the number of sound
    sources (i.e *,wav) files which can be loaded at once.  The default is 
    256, sufficient for small routes (i.e. the Zig-Zag route, but insufficient
    for some of the MSTS routes  This results in a series of errors when 
    the -DSOUND compiler option is used.
    
    The enclosed file 'alsoft.conf' includes the line 'sources=1023'.  This
    increases the number of sources sufficient for the MSTS routes, but at 
    the cost of an increased overhead.  A planned development of the code
    will allow sounds to be loaded when needed and released when no longer
    required.  In the meantime the configuration file can be placed either 
    in the users home directory or in the system directory:
      $HOME/.config/alsoft.conf
      /etc/openal/alsoft.conf
    
    
    The commit includes an option to generate a movie (as yet without a
    sound channel) either be generating a set of png images or by using
    the ffmpeg library.
    
    It also includes an initial trial of a shader which is used for the 
    parts of the display which do not need the lighting calculations or
    the use of textures.
    
    Both of the new options can be included by setting the corresponding
    flags in the makefile.
