Commit 0.6.4
============

    ZR was initially developed using the Australian Zig-zag route and the
    standard MSTS routes.  Tests with other routes showed a number of bugs,
    some of which being due to errors in the route files which OpenRails
    sidesteps.  This commit includes a number of bug fixes of both kinds.
    
    The commit includes an option to geenrate a movie (as yet without a
    sound channel) either be generating a set of png images or by using
    the ffmpeg library.
    
    It also includes an initial trial of a shader which is used for the 
    parts of the display which do not need the lighting calculations or
    the use of textures.
    
    Bothe of the new options can be included by setting the corresponding
    flags in the makefile.
