Version 0.6.3
=============

    Bugfix commit.  These are further bugs that showed up when 
    testing ZR using different routes.  See README.ROUTES.

Configuration file changes.

    The program works as before when the configuration file
    (~/.zr/config) defines both ORdir and ORroutedir.
    
    If the configuration file defines a single top level directory
    using the 'ORdir = ...', statement, then this is the one used.
    If 'ORroutedir' is defined or the directory contains only one 
    route then this is the one used.  If not the user is asked to 
    choose the route.
    
    If the configuration file contains more than one ORdir line,
    then the user is given an option of which top level directory
    to use.  If this contains more than one route, the user is 
    is again asked to choose.
    
    There are then options to choose engines, carriages, wagons
    and consists and the starting platform or siding.
