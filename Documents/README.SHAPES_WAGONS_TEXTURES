README.SHAPES_WAGONS_TEXTURES
=============================

1.  The full set of shapes, wagons and textures packaged with
    each route can be displayed by compiling the program
    with suitable command line parameters.

    This is most easily done through the makefile by uncommenting
    i.e. removing the '#' character, from the start of the corresponding
    line of the makefile

    To Display        Command line parameter

    Shapes            -D_Display_Shapes
    Wagons            -D_Display_Wagons
    Textures          -D_Display_Textures

    Before compiling ensure that all the 'ROUTE' option lines are
    commented out, with a '#' at the start of the line.

2.  When the program starts, it goes through the standard sequence
    of choosing the top directory and one of the routes (although
    the program will display the shapes etc. for all the routes
    under the top directory).

3.  When the shapes and wagons are displayed, they are laid out on
    a flat plane, a few metres below the viewpoint, on a grid
    extending into the distance.  The normal controls can be used
    to move the viewpoint and change the direction of view.

    When textures are displayed, they are laid out in a similar
    manner but the view looks vertically downwards at the shape
    textures.  The textures used by wagons are placed in a second
    block placed a short distance to the right.  Again the normal
    controls can be used to change the viewpoint.
